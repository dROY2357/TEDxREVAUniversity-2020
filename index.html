            Usually, fables are the stories that features inanimate objects and forces of nature that are brought to life and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson and takes us through a lifelike journey, portraying good and evil and we absorb an understanding of importance of right and wrong. But similarly every individual have a story, some short and some long, where they live and love, make mistake, win and fail, where the choices made by them lead to an effect as an consequences of the decisions made and choices taken. These effects teaches us many lessons and gives us many ideas. The ideas that are learnt are applicable to all and always contain the good and right choices of life, hence they must be spread to fill the world with good and right and every story is worth hearing.
